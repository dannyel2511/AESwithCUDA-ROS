# Implementation of the AES algorithm using CUDA

The aim of this project is to integrate the use of the AES algorithm within ROS.
By doing this, the data sent trough nodes will be secured, because it will be encrypted. Thus, only the authorized nodes can read the messages, those are the ones that have the key to decipher the data.
